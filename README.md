## Hi, I'm Julien 👋🏽👨🏽‍💻

Also called `Jusdeliens` (aka `j2l`, meaning `link juice` in french), as the name of the company I have founded in 2018.

Passionate about electrical and computing engineering applied to medical and educational fields, to enhance and link people and knowledge for all equally 

- 🔭 I'm currently working on
    - 🤖 [Ova](https://jusdeliens.com/ova), a pocket bot mate for learning by doing AI robotic and software development
    - 🩺  [Aqsaniit](https://www.aurora-sterilisation.com), the next generation of medical devices sterilizer
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on any project where my skills and values can benefit, specially in medical or educational fields
- 💖 Philosophy : **Ubuntu** meaning `We are what we are because of who we all are` 

## 💬 Get in touch
I love interacting with different people all over the world, so feel free to say hi or follow me 👇🏽
- on [my company website](https://jusdeliens.com) which synthesizes all the work I have achieved so far with the help of my students and our partners
- on [my personal Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/julien-arné-08829b100) where I share updates of courses I teach, and robotic challenges we organize
- on [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/users/bcmwJke538P?type=circuits) where I share circuits and 3D designs that I use during my courses. You need to [connect or create a Tinkercad account](https://www.tinkercad.com/login) to be able to see them

## 🧘🏽‍♂️ Jusdeliens' mindset

### 🧬 Multidisciplinary curiosity hardwired in DNA
My journey towards software development and data science began with a passion for the human body and the way we try to reproduce it into biomimetic engineered systems. After several attempts, I finally created the tiny [Ova](https://jusdeliens.com/ova) bot, in this attempt to nurture scientific vocations and creativity with these nonlinear passions in mind 🧠 and heart 💖.

### 🛠️ Understand hardware to build better software
If I can't explain the physics, I can't explain the logic either. And if I can't explain, I can't fully understand nor master it. This is why, I love diving into complex datasheets or RFC to build electronic systems and invite you to play [interactive simulations](https://play.jusdeliens.com) in which we can fully understand the way softwares interact with the hardware, using reductionist and systemic approaches. It is also why I thrive working with low level languages (such as `VHDL`, `ASM`, `C`,`C++`) and desktop/backend techs that inherits from theses (like `Python`, `C#`, `PHP`, `SQL`), even if I am amazed when I use front-end (`Vue.js`, `Svelte`) or devops techs (`Docker`, `Gitlab CI/CD`) that allows us to build & deploy web sites and apps so fastly whatever the hardware.  

### 🗺️ Plan for the worse, and code for the best
As a software developper and a project manager, I fell in love 🥰 with 🌱 [Plantuml](https://plantuml.com/fr/) and 🧜‍♀️ [Mermaid](mermaid.live) tools, that I now use in our every projects in combination with `gitlab`, `github`, `gitea` and their kanban tool embedded. It gives a large overview of how to implement functionalities driven by the consumer needs working in team, how to maintain these over time, while allowing the use of best practices such as design patterns, UML, OOP, SOLID, DDD.

### 🗑️ GIGO bytes of data won't make us smarter
Knowing the `Garbage In, Garbage Out` saying and the hardware beneath AI or any algorithm, remind us to better understand that qualified and supervised systems by and for humans are the key to solve some of our problems, but not all, specially if it not benefits to the greater good. 

I am an eco-technologic-enthousiast, that is why I focus my energy to share my knowledge, build a community eager to learn and share as well, so that we can solve all our problems together, not one for all, but all for all (the `Ubuntu` way).

This is what I think make us smarter. 

## 🤗 Welcome to my Github
Feel free to share it and [ask me anything](https://www.linkedin.com/in/julien-arné-08829b100), I'll be glad to help 😉
