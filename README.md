## Hi, I'm Julien 👋🏽👨🏽‍💻

Also called `Jusdeliens` (aka `j2l`, meaning `juice link` in french), as the name of the company I have founded in 2018.

I am passionate about electrical and computing engineering applied to medical and educational fields, to enhance and connect people, and share knowledge and build skills equally.   

- 🔭 I'm currently working on 🤖 [Ova](https://jusdeliens.com/ova), a pocket bot mate for learning by doing AI robotic and software development 
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on any project where my skills and values can benefit, specially in medical or educational fields
- 💖 Philosophy : **Ubuntu** meaning `We are what we are because of who we all are` 

## Get in touch
I love interacting with different people all over the world, so feel free to say hi or follow me 👇🏽

## Know more about me

### 🧬 Multidisciplinary curiosity hardwired in DNA
My journey towards software development and data science began with a passion for the human body and the way we try to reproduce it into biomimetic engineered systems. I created the tiny [Ova](https://jusdeliens.com/ova) bot, in this attempt to nurture scientific vocations and creativity with these passions in mind 🧠 and heart 💖.

### 🛠️ Understand hardware to build better software
If I can't explain the hardware, I can't explain the software either. And if I can't explain, I can't understand nor master it. This is why, part of my time, I love diving into complex hardware datasheets to build electronic systems in which I can fully understand the way softwares interact with the hardware. It is also why I thrive working with low level languages such as C/C++ and desktop & backend techs that inherits from theses languages like Python, C#, Javascript, Typescript ...   

### 🗺️ Plan for the worse, and code for the best
As a software developper and a project manager, I fell in love 🥰 with 🌱 [Plantuml](https://plantuml.com/fr/) and 🧜‍♀️ [Mermaid](mermaid.live) tools, that I now use in every projects in combination with `git`, `github`, [gitea](https://about.gitea.com/) and their kanban tools embedded. It gives 
- a large overview of how to implement functionalities driven by the consumer needs working in team
- how to maintain these over time
- while allowing the use of best practices such as design patterns, UML, OOP, SOLID, DDD
